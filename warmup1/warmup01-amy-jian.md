#### Ingredients

-   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
-   2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or rosemary leaves
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   2 pounds yukon gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch slices
-   1 cup chicken or vegetable stock or low-sodium broth
-   3 to 4 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed

#### Special Tools Needed

-   Large bowl
-   9x13 inch (quarter sheet) **metal** baking pan
-   Thin spatula
-   Oven

#### Cooking Instructions

1.  Heat oven to 500 degrees F.
2.  Place melted butter in the bottom of a large bowl. Stir in herbs, if using, salt, and pepper. Add potato slices and mix to evenly coat them.
3.  Spread potato slices and all of the good stuff at the bottom of the bowl in baking pan.
4.  Roast potatoes for 15 minutes.
5.  Use a thin spatula to loosen potatoes and turn them over.
6.  Roast for a second 15 minutes.
7.  Carefully pour stock or broth into pan and add the garlic cloves.
8.  Roast for 15 minutes more, until potatoes are fully tender.
9.  Remove from oven. Transfer to a serving platter along with any remaining liquid in pan and serve warm.

This recipe can also be made using other types of potatoes that are more floury like Russet potatoes or by substituting butter with olive oil.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

### Definition \[edit\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\mathbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>,..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>,..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
The position of a point in Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitiude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$\\lvert\\rvert\\mathbf{p}\\lvert\\rvert = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\cdots + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}},$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
