library(binomial)
```

The package 'binomial' implements functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

##Combinations with bin_choose( )

Suppose we want to know how many combinations of size _k_ can be created from a group of _n_ items or $\binom{n}{k}$. We can calculate this using 'bin_choose( )'.

For example we can find the number of combinations in which 3 successes can occur in 5 trials:
```{r}
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 3)
```

'bin_choose( )' only accepts arguments where _k_ is less than _n_.

##Binomial Probability

'bin_probability( )' calculates the binomial probability:
$$P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$
where:
  
  * _n_ is the fixed number of trials (_n_ ≥ 0)
  * _p_ is the probability of success in each trial (0 ≤ _p_ ≤ 1)
  * _1-p_ is the probability of failure in each trial
  * _k_ is number of successes out of _n_ trials (0 ≤ _k_ ≤ _n_)

Suppose we want to find the probability that we get 4 heads out of 6 tosses of a fair coin. Then we can use 'bin_probability( )':
```{r}
bin_probability(success=4, trials = 6, prob = 0.5)
```

'bin_probability( )' can also take in a vector of success values. To find the probability of getting 1, 2, and 4 heads out of 6 tosses of a fair coin:
```{r}
bin_probability(success = c(1, 2, 4), trials = 6, prob = 0.5)
```

##Binomial Distribution

'bin_probability( )' calculates the binomial probability of select numbers of sucesses. Now suppose we want to know the binomial probability for every possible number of successes out of _n_ trials. 'bin_distribution( )' displays a data frame of the entire probability distribution of a binomial random variable with _n_ trials and probability of success _p_.

The binomial probability distribution with _n_ = 5 and _p_ = 0.5:
```{r}
distribution <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
distribution
```

'plot( )' will produce a graphic of the probabilities of successes:
```{r}
plot(distribution)
```

##Cumulative Distribution

So far we have been looking only at the probabilities of exactly _k_ successes in _n_ trials $P(X = k)$. Now suppose we want to know the cumulative probability $P(X≤k)$, the probability that we get _k_ or less successes in _n_ trials. 'bin_cumulative( )' displays a data frame of the probability distribution and the cumulative probability values.

For a binomial random variable with _n_ = 5 and _p_ = 0.5, the cumulative disribution would be:
```{r}
cumulative <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
cumulative
```

'plot( )' will produce a graphic of the cumulative probabilities of successes:
```{r}
plot(cumulative)
```

##Summary measures
Suppose we want to know more about a binomial variable such as its mean, variance, etc.

###Creating a 'binvar'
The first step is to create a 'binvar' object using 'bin_variable( )'. We must specify the number of trials _n_ and the probability of success _p._

A binomial variable with _n_ = 5 and _p_ = 0.5:
```{r}
myvariable <- bin_variable(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
myvariable
```

###Displaying a summary
Once we have a 'binvar' object, we can use 'summary( )' to display the following measures:
  
  * mean or expected value
  * variance
  * mode(s)
  * skewness, the measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution about the mean
  * kurtosis, the measure of "tailedness" of the probability distribution
  
```{r}
summary(myvariable)
```

###Specific summary measures
Suppose we don't want to find all the summary values of a binomial variable; we just want one specific measure like the mean or mode(s). The following functions take in 2 inputs, number of trials _n_ and probability of success _p_, and calculates a single summary measure.

* 'bin_mean( )'
* 'bin_variance( )'
* 'bin_mode( )'
* 'bin_skewness( )'
* 'bin_kurtosis( )'

Let's use a binomial variable with _n_ = 5 and _p_ = 0.5

To find the mean:
```{r}
bin_mean(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```
To find the variance:
```{r}
bin_variance(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```
To find the mode(s):
```{r}
bin_mode(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```
Note: If there is a unique mode, 'bin_mode( )' will return a single value. Otherwise, it may return a vector of 2 values (as seen in above example).

Example of unique mode:
```{r}
bin_mode(trials = 4, prob = 0.5)
```
To find the skewness:
```{r}
bin_skewness(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```
To find the kurtosis:
```{r}
bin_kurtosis(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```
